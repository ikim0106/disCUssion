# Brief Introduction
CSCI3100 Spring 2022 Group E4\
disCUssion is a simple real-time chatting application that aims to provide (mainly) CU students with a platform to find each other by name or email (or even SID if you signed up with your CUHK email, which is highly recommended). Asking another person for a phone number can be rather uncomfortable for some people in certain situations, as the intention can be misunderstood. With just their disCUssion name or SID, you can quickly contact them and get a group chat started with other people. 

# Distinguishing Qualities
We were well aware that our proposed project could be completed relatively easily if we used Google Firebase or some other third-party service (i.e. CometChat) that provides the features and tools that we need, but we took the challenge to write almost everything (signup, login, database integration, emailing, chat engine features, etc.) with self-written APIs, tools, and other existing APIs.
